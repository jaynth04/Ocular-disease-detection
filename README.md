# Ocular-disease-detection
This project uses machine learning to detect ocular diseases from retinal images with improved accuracy. It analyzes key eye features to identify early signs of conditions like cataracts, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy. The system automates diagnosis support, reducing manual workload for ophthalmologists.
